## Welcome to the Loyalty Harvest backend

You can find the original `README.md` generated by Foundry at `FREADME.md`

The backend relies on one smart contract, named `Claim.sol`, and four main scripts: `createMerkle.js`, `createLeaves.js`, `createProof.js`, `createSig.js`.

## Testing

Run `forge test` to test the `Claim` contract.

To run the scripts: `node js/create<NAME>.js` with the remaining file name filled in after the `create`.

For example to create a Merkle tree you can run `node js/createMerkle.js`.
